# TailwindCSSDemo

A quick demo of how to setup tailwindcss. 

It includes a default setup and configuration of tailwindcss with 
no bells and whistles or extra customisation steps, just simply a setup to get started.

I recommend though customising the tailwind config file to setup your own preferences for things 
like spacing, fonts, breakpoints, and colors.

You can also add in the usage of webpack for example to compile JS as well. This example only
shows how to compile tailwind.

Bear in mind that tailwind uses PostCSS :)

## Installation

Just clone this repo and run `npm install`

## Usage

Look at the npm scripts, for local dev run `npm run dev` and production run `npm run prod`
